# LeetCode SQL Problem 1393 - Capital Gain/Loss

## üìò Problem Description

Given a table `Stocks` that records stock buy/sell operations, calculate the **capital gain or loss** for each stock.

- The capital gain/loss is calculated as the **total difference** between the selling price and the corresponding buying price for each stock.
- It is guaranteed:
  - Every `Buy` has a corresponding `Sell` after it.
  - Every `Sell` has a corresponding `Buy` before it.

Return the result in any order.

## üß† Explanation

- For **Leetcode**:
  - Buy @ 1000 on day 1, Sell @ 9000 on day 5 ‚Üí Gain = `9000 - 1000 = 8000`
- For **Handbags**:
  - Buy @ 30000 on day 17, Sell @ 7000 on day 29 ‚Üí Loss = `7000 - 30000 = -23000`
- For **Corona Masks**:
  - Buy @ 10 (day 2), Sell @ 1010 (day 3) ‚Üí Gain = 1000
  - Buy @ 1000 (day 4), Sell @ 500 (day 5) ‚Üí Loss = -500
  - Buy @ 1000 (day 6), Sell @ 10000 (day 10) ‚Üí Gain = 9000
  - Total = `1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500`
