# LeetCode SQL Problem 1407 - Top Travellers

## üìò Problem Description

Given two tables, `Users` and `Rides`, write a solution to report the **total distance traveled** by each user.

- Every user must be included, even if they have not taken any rides (in that case, total distance = 0).
- Sort the results by:
  1. `travelled_distance` in **descending** order
  2. If tied, sort by `name` in **ascending** order

## üóÉÔ∏è Table Schemas

### Users Table

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |

- `id` is the unique identifier for each user.

### Rides Table

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| user_id     | int     |
| distance    | int     |

- `id` is the unique identifier for each ride.
- `user_id` refers to the user who took the ride.
- `distance` is the number of miles traveled in that ride.

## üß† Explanation

- **Lee** took 3 rides totaling `100 + 120 + 230 = 450`.
- **Elvis** took 2 rides totaling `50 + 400 = 450`.
- Although both traveled the same distance, **Elvis** comes before **Lee** alphabetically.
- **Donald** took no rides, so his distance is `0` but still appears in the results.
