# LeetCode SQL Problem 3465 - Find Products with Valid Serial Numbers

## üìò Problem Description

Your task is to **find all products whose description contains a valid serial number**.

A valid serial number follows **all** of the following rules:
- Starts with `SN` (case-sensitive),
- Followed by **exactly 4 digits**,
