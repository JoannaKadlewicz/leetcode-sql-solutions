*Note*: This table will grow as I add more solutions. Each directory includes a detailed explanation and commented SQL code.

## 🛠️ How It’s Organized
Each problem has its own directory, named with the problem number and title (e.g., `176_second_highest_salary`). Inside each directory, you’ll find:
- **README.md**: Problem description, my approach, challenges faced, and time/space complexity.
- **solution.sql**: The SQL solution with inline comments for clarity.

Example:
```
leetcode-sql-solutions/
├── 175_combine_two_tables/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── solution.sql
├── 176_second_highest_salary/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── solution.sql
...
```

## 🚀 Why This Project Rocks
This repository isn’t just about solving problems. It’s about showcasing my ability to write efficient SQL queries, explain complex logic clearly, and apply data manipulation skills to real-world scenarios.
Explore the solutions, check out the code, and let me know what you think! 😎
