## üåü About This Repository
This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode SQL problems, each organized in its own directory with:
- **README.md**: Problem description and complexity analysis.
- **solution.sql**: The SQL query written in PostgreSQL or MySQL syntax.

The goal? To provide clean, optimized solutions and clear explanations that highlight my SQL expertise and problem-solving mindset.

*Note*: This table will grow as I add more solutions. Each directory includes a detailed explanation and commented SQL code.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It‚Äôs Organized
Each problem has its own directory, named with the problem number and title (e.g., `176_second_highest_salary`). Inside each directory, you‚Äôll find:
- **README.md**: Problem description, my approach, challenges faced, and time/space complexity.
- **solution.sql**: The SQL solution with inline comments for clarity.

Example:
```
leetcode-sql-solutions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 175_combine_two_tables/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ solution.sql
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 176_second_highest_salary/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ solution.sql
...
```

## üöÄ Why This Project Rocks
This repository isn‚Äôt just about solving problems. It‚Äôs about showcasing my ability to write efficient SQL queries, explain complex logic clearly, and apply data manipulation skills to real-world scenarios.
Explore the solutions, check out the code, and let me know what you think! üòé
