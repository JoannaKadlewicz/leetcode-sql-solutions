# LeetCode SQL Solutions
Mastering Data Manipulation with SQL 🧙‍♂️

Welcome to my **LeetCode SQL Solutions** repository! This collection showcases my ability to tackle complex SQL problems with clear, efficient, and well-documented queries. As a data analyst, I use these solutions to demonstrate my proficiency in data manipulation, query optimization, and analytical problem-solving—skills. Dive in to explore my approach to LeetCode's SQL challenges! 💻🔍

## 🌟 About This Repository
This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode SQL problems, each organized in its own directory with:
- **README.md**: Problem description and complexity analysis.
- **solution.sql**: The SQL query written in PostgreSQL or MySQL syntax.

The goal? To provide clean, optimized solutions and clear explanations that highlight my SQL expertise and problem-solving mindset.

## 📋 Solved Problems
Below is a list of solved LeetCode SQL problems. Click on a problem to view its description and solution.

| 182            | [Duplicate Emails](182_duplicate_emails/README.md)                                                     | Easy       | [Solution](182_duplicate_emails/solution.sql) |

*Note*: This table will grow as I add more solutions. Each directory includes a detailed explanation and commented SQL code.

## 🛠️ How It’s Organized
Each problem has its own directory, named with the problem number and title (e.g., `176_second_highest_salary`). Inside each directory, you’ll find:
- **README.md**: Problem description, my approach, challenges faced, and time/space complexity.
- **solution.sql**: The SQL solution with inline comments for clarity.

Example:
```
leetcode-sql-solutions/
├── 175_combine_two_tables/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── solution.sql
├── 176_second_highest_salary/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── solution.sql
...
```

## 🚀 Why This Project Rocks
This repository isn’t just about solving problems—it’s about showcasing my ability to write efficient SQL queries, explain complex logic clearly, and apply data manipulation skills to real-world scenarios.
Explore the solutions, check out the code, and let me know what you think! 😎
