## üß† Explanation

- For project 1, employees have experience years: 3, 2, and 1. The average is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00.
- For project 2, employees have experience years: 3 and 2. The average is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50.
- The query reports the average experience years per project rounded to 2 decimal places.
